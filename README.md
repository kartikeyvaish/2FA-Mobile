To set up 2FA Android Application for development, you need to follow the steps mentioned below:

- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Step 1: Install Node.js from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

During the developement process, I used node version v14.17.4. You can check your node version by running the following command:

```shell
node -v
```

### Step 2: Setup [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) environment.

Follow the steps mentioned in the official documentation to setup the environment.

    cd 2FA-Mobile

    npm install

### Step 5: Running the application

Connect a physical device or an emulator to your computer. You can read more about connecting to a
physical device or emulator [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device).
